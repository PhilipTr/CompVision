Inside the "project" file there is the emotion.ipynb file which will train the emotion CNN model. Run this file to get the "best.pth" model.
Inside the "class_project" file there is the test1.py file which will combine the different models into a fusion model. Running this file will start the webcam for predictions.
Both files have their own requirement.txt files which contains the downloads for the dependencies. "pip install -r requirements.txt" to download them.
